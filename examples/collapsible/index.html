					HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
					example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using
					images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML
					and its functions.

					JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web
					pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to
					look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video
					jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer
					cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in
					other parts of the Learning Area.
